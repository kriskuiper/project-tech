# Contributing to my `project-tech` repo
I'm glad you're interested in working on my repo! Here are some contributing and code standards to help you on your way with contributing to this project.

## Pull requests
When you want to actively contribute to this repository, please first discuss the change you want to make by opening an [issue]() or emailing me. Please be brief yet descriptive when submitting a pull request. 

## Commit messages
When you're doing commits it would be nice if others would be able to read what you've done, so always be brief but descriptive in your commit messages, like so:

```
git commit -m "Add upload functionality to form"
```

Or, if you need multiple lines:

```
git commit -m "Refactor index.js
> 1. Use ES6 arrow-functions instead of ES5 functions
> 2. Add consistent spacing everywhere"
```
